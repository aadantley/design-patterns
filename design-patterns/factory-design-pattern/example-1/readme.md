# Custom implementation

This project contains a custom implementation of the factory design pattern.

This pattern will use a `IBook` interface to create books of different genres:

- sci-fi
- drama
- comedy

## To Start

Kickoff this project with `python client.py` and input your favorite genre of movie to see if its already apart of the book factory.

If not, update the book factory with your favorite genre.

## To Do

- [ ] add unit tests
